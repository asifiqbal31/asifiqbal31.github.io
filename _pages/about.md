Greetings! this is Asif Iqbal.
I originally hail from Bangladesh and currently have been living in Ontario, Canada for more
than 15 years. I have been working as a software engineer for almost 13 years with a focus in big
data and data engineering in recent times.

You can catch a glimpse of my professional career [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asif-iqbal-2946a712/).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `asif_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
